                <p>Lessig is confident that academics and activists can unite around this effort for stage 2 of Mayday’s plan.  On May 1, 2015, Mayday will officially launch its citizen lobbying platform to crowdsource activists’ voices to influence incumbent members of Congress and recruit those members to support campaign finance reform.</p>

A surprise seven-figure surge into South Dakota’s four-way Senate race roused the party committees, which counter-attacked and bailed out now-Senator Mike Rounds by comparing Democrat Rick Weiland to President Obama.</p>

                <p>And so, in this weekend’s Medium post, Lessig announced that Mayday would not just raise money to buy ads and swing elections. He envisioned “a crowd-sourced project to identify possible allies in Congress” and “a platform that we have been building to engage citizens as lobbyists.” Upshot: Mayday would not play kingmaker in elections the way it had in 2014, because that didn’t work.</p>

                <p>“These are our first few steps,” Lessig said today in a statement prior to the speech.  “No doubt, they will change.  Indeed, we’re committed to the possibility of them changing. Because the fundamental commitment of this project is not to any particular technique.  The commitment is to a process of experimentation:  We will try a strategy, and learn from it.  And then will either modify it or abandon it, based on what we learn.  So that as we move through the list of potential allies for reform, our citizen lobbying machine will only get better.  We will learn better how to convince – first voters and then funders, on our way to recruiting incumbents to reform.”</p>

                <p>“In 2014, less than 2% of America gave anything to anyone running for Congress. But of those who did, the top 100 gave as much as the bottom 4.75 million.  Less than .05% gave the maximum in even one election cycle.  Less than half of that gave the equivalent of the maximum in both cycles.  And 100 Americans gave 70% of the SuperPAC money spent through the cycle.  We have to change this, if we’re to give ordinary Americans a reason to care about their politics again.”</p>

There are too many issues that need a government that can think – from climate change to the deficit, from inequality to a crazy tax system, from endless spending on “defense” to endless gifts to crony capitalists.

                <p>So no, obviously, we didn’t give up. Instead, we went back to the drawing board. The key lesson that now frames our thinking is the recognition that we can’t do something different unless we are different too.</p>

                <p>But victory will require more than committed candidates. Voters must turn out at the polls to elect them, something which at the moment and despite Lessig’s optimism, they are not prepared to do. For that to happen the electorate will have to be convinced that publicly funded candidates will be responsive to the needs of the middle class and low income groups in ways that the current cohort of privately funded elected officials are not. To win, reform candidates will have to combine their call for public funding of elections with the promise to enact policies that materially improve voters’ lives by, for example, increasing the income and employment of those who have been most shut out of the country’s economic gains. Such campaigns will require a massive field operation. People will not be convinced by television ads that politics really can be changed. Person to person persuasion will be needed.</p>

                <p>A great beneficiary of Lessig’s vision, if its realization properly is structured, is our elected officials. Lessig doesn’t intend to, and does not, undermine their job security. Adopting his plan would improve the quality of our officials’ lives immensely. Lessig isn’t prescribing Castor oil. If he stops treating it like something one has to coax a recalcitrant child into taking “for your own good”  he will encounter far less opposition.</p>

                <p>If he presents it shrewdly, Lessig’s most enthusiastic constituency well could become … Members of Congress. Our elected officials almost unanimously detest having to spend the majority of their discretionary time dialing for dollars. These lovely people came to Washington to represent their district and make America a better place. Lessig’s plan could make doing that job easier and much more delightful (both to us voters and our Representatives).</p>

                <p>Mayday’s laying its plans right now, and there are a couple of avenues for that. There’s this army of people – almost 70,000 people now – who donated to Mayday in the last round.

                <p>Mayday’s constituency, Mayday’s tribe, is made of people who are frustrated by how the system works. And it should be focused on them, and frankly it seems like it’s more a small-dollar community than a big-dollar community. That means there’s going to be more patient, grassroots-focused organizing, but it also means that there’s going to be an army of constituents in all these cities across the country that can do lobbying work. And giving people more avenues to have an impact than just donating is going to be a key part of Mayday’s future.</p>

This election cycle, he started a crowd-funded SuperPAC aimed at reducing the influence of money in politics. Lessig tells Bill: “Our democracy is flat lined. Because when you can show clearly there’s no relationship between what the average voter cares about, only if it happens to coincide with what the economic elite care about, you’ve shown that we don’t have a democracy anymore.”</p>

                <p>I spoke by phone last week with the political activist and Harvard Law School professor Larry Lessig, who earlier this year launched Mayday, a self-styled “crowd-funded SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs…including this one,” to agitate for campaign-finance reform (although he considers that phrase a euphemism comparable to “liquid-intake problem” for alcoholism). Mayday has raised over $10 million to date, but saw only mixed results in the races that it invested in. Lessig’s sure the public can be rallied, but admits that it’s a long road. “I’m in the camp of people who think it’s not quite fair to criticize” people who wonder what reason there is to vote. He said, “I think it’s pretty reasonable for people not to engage in a system like this.”</p>

                <p>While we have data that demonstrates voters in these races did care about the issue, it simply wasn’t enough–in an election of this kind of historic proportion–to make enough of a difference. But that doesn’t mean we can’t and won’t in the future. Those of us who are committed to this issue see it the same light you might if you got a fatal cancer diagnosis for your child.

                <p>And we won’t. What particularly pains me in this instance, is not so much the electoral losses, but the apparent glee that some of Lessig’s detractors, and even some of his colleagues in the reform movement jealous of his attention, have expressed over the outcome. Having worked closely with Lessig and many others over the years on these issues, I say this confidently: There is no more passionate, committed, creative and articulate advocate on these issues than Larry Lessig.</p>

                <p>So let’s be perfectly clear about this: The notion that quiet, behind-the-scenes politicking can someday lead to comprehensive campaign finance reform is patently absurd. We’re talking about reversing the effects of the most significant and well-known Supreme Court decision since Bush v. Gore, drastically shrinking a multi-billion dollar industry overnight, and wrenching power away from some of the most power-hungry people in the entire world.</p>

                <p>Lessig was not “siphoning off money that could have [been] spent more effectively by existing groups,” he was raising money that otherwise would likely have never gone towards campaign finance reform at all. Maybe the “ivory tower egghead” doesn’t have a “radio voice,” but he’s brought new energy, supporters and ideas to a campaign that sorely needed them. Instead of trashing Lessig in Politico, his ostensible allies should be thanking their lucky stars he joined the team.</p>

An Article V convention has no power to change the constitution on its own. Its only power, as the Constitution plainly states, is “for proposing Amendments.” And evidence now available because of the Internet to every American shows that it was the political bodies closest to the American people, state legislatures, that were meant to use the Article V convention process to propose the necessary constitutional changes.</p>

                <p>Both sides, however, are playing out on the airwaves with Clements spending $271,000 on television advertising on top of the $1.2 million SuperPAC MayDay has spent in an attempt to unseat one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress where he is the chairman of the influential Energy and Commerce Committee. Upton, meanwhile, has spent $1 million on TV advertising, according to the Washington Post.</p>

                <p>The campaign has $127,000 cash on hand, a fraction of the $1.6 million Upton has left over after raising nearly $3 million this election. It’s in the details where the starkest differences between the campaigns come to light. About $2.1 million of Upton’s campaign war chest came from Political Action Committees.</p>

                <p>The American Democracy Legal Fund claims that the Republican Congressman violated federal law and House rules by improperly threatening retribution against contributors to a super Pac. The Mayday super Pac recently announced that it was spending $1.5-million on ads in the district critical of Upton, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Huffington Post reported that a staff member of that committee contacted donors to the fund to express displeasure.</p>

                <p>On October 9, Mayday announced it was going after Upton for being the “worst of the worst,” exemplifying “money’s corrupting influence in politics,” and it has since dumped nearly $1.5 million into negative ads in the lawmaker’s southwestern Michigan home base. That’s been enough to put a serious scare into Upton, who won his last election with 55 percent of the vote in a swing district that Obama carried in 2008 and lost, narrowly, to Romney in 2012. Last Friday, Upton told the Kalamazoo Gazette editorial board that he’s tracked down Mayday donors.</p>

                <p>While Upton maintains the super PAC attacks haven’t changed his strategy–or made him any more vulnerable–his opponents see a candidate on the defensive. Mayday’s first ad targeted the incumbent on Medicare drug prices and failing to protect patients with preexisting conditions. Days later, an Upton ad lamented the “lies” opponents were spreading and touting his efforts to help seniors on Medicare and patients with preexisting conditions. It’s an unusual tack for a Republican who has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Obamacare.</p>

                <p>The two groups are separate entities. PCCC is focused on promoting a progressive political agenda, while MayDay, which was founded by Harvard Law School professor and activist Lawrence Lessig, is dedicated to campaign finance reform. However, MayDay recruited the PCCC’s independent expenditure team to manage several of its efforts this cycle and, in those races, the PAC’s efforts are clearly aiding the “Warren wing” strategy.</p>

                <p>So, why would Mayday walk onto the field? The PAC points to a new Public Policy Polling survey that shows Republican Mike Rounds, a former governor who easily won two terms, slipping to 35 percent support against Weiland’s 28 percent. Weiland’s favorables have surpassed those of Rounds; in a four-way race with former Senator Larry Pressler and conservative Gordon Howie, PPP suggested that Weiland had the most potential to surge.</p>

                <p>The candidates that Americans get to choose from of course have been selected by voters in primaries. But to be able to run in a primary, or in a general election, those candidates must secure an extraordinary amount of campaign cash. The providers of that cash aren’t all of us. And they are certainly not even a representative sample of us. They are instead a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1 percent (arguably the same proportion of America as 1,200 is of Hong Kong), which, as a massive empirical study by Princeton’s Martin Gilens and Ben Page suggests, produces a government that is responsive to the “economic elite and organized business interests,” but not at all to “the preferences of the average American.” We have, like Hong Kong would have, a biased filter at the first stage of our democracy. And that bias produces a government that is not responsive to us.</p>

How could we believe that the thickness of one’s wallet is the metric of citizenship?” He sketched a dire portrait of American politics. More than ninety-nine per cent of Americans are excluded from the access that large campaign donations afford, he said. And yet people have accepted this state of affairs. He cited a poll in which ninety-six per cent of Americans said they believe that it’s important to reduce the influence of money in politics but only nine per cent believe that it is likely to happen. The Mayday PAC, Lessig said, was intended to elect a Congress that would pass reform and demonstrate to Americans that change was possible. “This is the moral question of our age,” he said. “Can we reclaim our democracy?”</p>

New York’s most recent gubernatorial race saw Zephyr Teachout win more than half of all counties in New York, strictly running on a platform of removing money from politics (though Andrew Cuomo still won). Lawrence Lessig runs the May-Day Super Pac, which is designed as the Super Pac to end all Super Pacs by financially supporting candidates who want to remove money from politics. The best news of all is that this is a bipartisan issue.

                <p>This is the thing about Mayday, as Harvard law Prof. Lawrence Lessig, one of the co-founders of the group, explained to the Post by phone: 2014 is, for them, the equivalent of poking an anthill with a stick to see what happens. Granted, they’ve got better analytical tools than sticks, and they’re being more thoughtful about what gets poked, but the analogy is generally accurate. By investing in a variety of races in 2014, Mayday hopes to learn if voters are sufficiently receptive to a campaign finance reform message to justify a bigger and better-funded push in 2016.</p>

He writes that 37% of primary voters surveyed said “reducing the corrupting influence of politics [sic] was a major or deciding factor in their vote for Senate.” (I think Lessig means reducing the influence of private money in politics, but does no one proofread his emails for him?) That said, a large chunk of that group apparently gave their votes to Brown (or, as Lessig put it “among that 37%, our candidate beat the Republican nominee by 18 points!”) which shows just how hard it is to impact voters’ opinions in a meaningful way.</p>

                <p>Early on, Rubens was basically a complete nobody. While he’d been in NH politics in the past, he hadn’t actually occupied a political office since the 1990s. He was basically roadkill for the political machine of Scott Brown. However Larry Lessig’s Mayday PAC noted that Rubens was the only Republican candidate running on an anti-corruption platform to limit the influence of money in politics. Mayday PAC spent heavily on campaign ads for Rubens, and he ended up getting around 24% of the vote, with Brown pulling in less than 50%.</p>

The pro-reform Mayday PAC, founded by former Bush media adviser Mark McKinnon and Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig, is targeting five to eight races this election. And after gleaning the data from those races, they “plan to scale up and go big in 2016,” says McKinnon.

The Massachusetts Republican, also a former state senator, will concentrate his practice on “business and governmental affairs as they relate to the financial services industry as well as on commercial real estate matters,” according to the firm.</p>

                <p>Over the weekend, Brown threatened to sue the super PAC over a mailer that claimed he was a lobbyist. In a letter to Harvard professor Larry Lessig, the founder of the group, Brown’s campaign manager said that Brown had never been a lobbyist. In 2013, he worked as a business and governmental affairs advisor at the Nixon Peabody law firm, but did not register as a lobbyist.</p>

                <p>Some candidates think their constituents don’t really care about campaign finance reform – something polls back up. Others might think that it’s hopeless to even entertain the idea of fixing it. Most of them, however, have probably grown to like the current state of money in politics, or are at least able to deal with the current regime.</p>

                <p>Mayday PAC has already raised more $7.8 million, a surprisingly high number. It’s one of several groups that have emerged this year as a force in the campaign finance reform movement.</p>

                <p>From what we have seen in the group’s FEC report, Mayday has had some success in attracting small dollar contributions. Of the $2,091,015 in itemized contributions it received from April through June, $481,269.88 came from donors who gave less than $1,000 total. An additional $1.2 million came from donors who gave less than $200. None of the itemized money came from other PACs or corporations.</p>

                <p>But the latest campaign finance push, however impractical or constitutionally suspect, has tapped a well of voter anger that politicians ignore at their peril. Public disgust with Congress, which according to Gallup now enjoys a record-low 7 percent approval rating</p>

                <p>Some campaign finance experts cast the uphill amendment drive as an ill-advised distraction from more pragmatic changes. Lessig’s Mayday PAC, for one, is focused not on amending the Constitution but on such changes as matching small-dollar donations with public funding</p>

                <p>Lessig has stressed that the group is non-partisan, and its rhetoric calls out the corrupting influence of money on both parties. Still, given the difficulty of finding Republicans who are willing to commit to genuine campaign finance reform, it seems likely that Mayday would mostly support Democrats.</p>

                <p>Mayday PAC explicitly says it wants to select five races that are tight enough so that it can claim that its campaign finance reform agenda made an impact. That’s where things get tricky. For one thing, most Congressional races aren’t even competitive, as Derek Willis notes at The Upshot, and the vast majority of incumbents win reelection.

In response, Lessig transformed his career, ending the work on Internet law that had made him famous and turning his sights on the impossible-seeming fight against money in politics.</p>

                <p>In some sense, Mayday’s approach seems paradoxical: taking money from one major industry and pitting it against another (the devil you know, and all that). But as Lessig points out, Mayday isn’t aimed specifically at pro-Silicon Valley legislation, like that pertaining to visas or net neutrality. “That wouldn’t be a very principled or interesting PAC,” he says. “The only thing the Mayday PAC is trying to do is get legislation passed to change the way elections are funded.”</p>

                <p>Be encouraged! Even though 96 percent of voters agree that money is a problem in politics (they’re right), 91 percent don’t believe it can be fixed (they’re wrong). We voters have more power than we think we do! On Tuesday, a congressional primary race in Virginia was won by a newcomer to politics who raised just over $200,000 for his campaign. His losing opponent (the incumbent) raised over $5 million.</p>

                <p>In his book “Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress – and a Plan to Stop It,” Lawrence Lessig proposes nonpartisan plans to end it. It’s a 300-page book, but let me wet your appetite with one paragraph from page 266. “First, we convert the first $50 dollars that each of us contributes to the Federal Treasury into a voucher. Call it a ‘democracy voucher.’ Each voter is free to allocate his or her democracy voucher as he or she wishes. Maybe $50 to a single candidate. Maybe $25 each to two candidates. Maybe $10 each to five candidates. The only requirement is that the candidate receiving the voucher must opt into the system.</p>

                <p>Larry Lessig’s MAYDAY.US. And, yes, we already wrote about this at the beginning of May when the first phase launched, and again when it hit the $1 million goal – and then secured the second million in matching funds. However, the project has now moved into phase two, where the goal is to raise (and match) $5 million, instead of just $1 million. Already it’s around half a million dollars, so there’s a long way to go, but it’s a good start.</p>

                <p>And, once again, the goal here is to raise this total of $12 million ($1 million + $1 million match in May, and then $5 million + $5 million match in June) as a test for a much larger effort. I’ve seen too many overly cynical folks say “$12 million isn’t enough to change politics.” And you’re right. But that’s not the goal. This is $12 million to be used in specific races as a proof of concept for a much larger moonshot.</p>

                <p>This is the hard work that Congress should do. It’s easy to hold hearings on resolutions that everyone knows will fail. It takes leadership to force debate on ideas that no one believes can pass–but must pass. That’s the leadership that Lyndon Johnson demonstrated, both in the Senate in 1957, and as President, when he forced a reluctant South to finally accept equal rights. That’s the leadership that this nation needs again, but that, in the grandstanding of D.C. partisanship, seems truly “impossible.”</p>

And for SuperPACs, the numbers are even tinier. In the 2012 election cycle, 132 Americans contributed 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in all races. Congress has become dependent upon this tiny slice of the 1 percent, but in no conceivable way does this tiny fraction represent America.”</p>

                <p>Campaign finance reform comes down to arguing about who gets to decide who gets to be umpire of a game which is, at its core, rigged. And it’s rigged in favor of the rich. Electoral politics is mostly cage matches in the gladiator arena they use to distract us. It’s the circus, and entitlements are the bread.</p>

                <p>Big money flowing into our elections is moving us ever further from Lincoln’s ideal: government of the people, for the people and by the people. This problem is not new, but what had been a tide is becoming a flood. With each campaign, our elected officials grow more dependent on big donations from special interests and less dependent on us, their constituents.</p>

                <p>We’ve reached a tipping point for reform. The Great Recession that began in 2007 exposed government and private institutions as deeply flawed and unable to protect ordinary people. The Supreme Court, contrary to common sense and the beliefs of most Americans, has declared that corporations are people and that enormous spending by a billionaire on politics is speech legally equivalent to actual speech by an ordinary citizen.</p>

                <p>Lessig and other leaders of this fight acknowledge it is a tough one. But they have reminded me that when millions of Americans across the political spectrum get riled up and demand change, Congress will listen and will act, and in due course, so will the Supreme Court.</p>

                <p>The Mayday PAC, set up to fight the influence of big money in politics, has raised a lot of money from small donors…but it has also raised more than $1 million (and hopes to raise at least $5 million more) from a few large donors. The large donors, many of them tech entrepreneurs, are matching funds raised in smaller chunks.</p>

                <p>If successful, Mayday PAC would go from inception to a war chest of over $12 million in just 60 days. That money will then fund campaigns in five congressional districts yet to be announced, targeting candidates that oppose campaign finance reform. It is part of a two election cycle plan to hold candidates accountable to voters on the issue of money in politics and win a Congress committed to enacting campaign finance reform by 2016. If successful in the 2014 cycle, the effort would be expanded for the 2016 elections.</p>

                <p>Call it <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig’s</a> “money bomb.”  It’s an ingenious plan to make the drive for small-dollar publicly funded elections a central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor’s idea could help save the republic.</p>

                <p>To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political spending.</p>

                <p>If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that’s by design. Cynicism and defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig believes, that the only way to “crack this cynicism” is with an idea so exceedingly ambitious–a “moonshoot,” he calls it–that people might be roused to get behind it.</p>

                <p>How bad has the money-in-politics situation gotten? A new study by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern universities found that, and I’m quoting directly here: “When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, <em>the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact</em> upon public policy.”</p>
