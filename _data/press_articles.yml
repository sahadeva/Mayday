  quotes:
    - 'Mayday PAC, however, also realized that simply electing fresh candidates is an overwhelming undertaking.  In order to reach the Congressional majority required to pass campaign finance legislation, Mayday needs to recruit sitting members of Congress as well.'
    - 'Lessig is confident that academics and activists can unite around this effort for stage 2 of Mayday’s plan.  On May 1, 2015, Mayday will officially launch its citizen lobbying platform to crowdsource activists’ voices to influence incumbent members of Congress and recruit those members to support campaign finance reform.'

  quotes:
    - 'The problem came when the voters got to vote. A cash infusion into Scott Brown&rsquo;s GOP primary did not prevent him from winning it. A surprise seven-figure surge into South Dakota&rsquo;s four-way Senate race roused the party committees, which counter-attacked and bailed out now-Senator Mike Rounds by comparing Democrat Rick Weiland to President Obama.'
    - 'And so, in this weekend&rsquo;s Medium post, Lessig announced that Mayday would not just raise money to buy ads and swing elections. He envisioned "a crowd-sourced project to identify possible allies in Congress" and "a platform that we have been building to engage citizens as lobbyists." Upshot: Mayday would not play kingmaker in elections the way it had in 2014, because that didn&rsquo;t work.'

  quotes:
   - '&ldquo;These are our first few steps,&rdquo; Lessig said today in a statement prior to the speech.  &ldquo;No doubt, they will change.  Indeed, we&rsquo;re committed to the possibility of them changing. Because the fundamental commitment of this project is not to any particular technique.  The commitment is to a process of experimentation:  We will try a strategy, and learn from it.  And then will either modify it or abandon it, based on what we learn.  So that as we move through the list of potential allies for reform, our citizen lobbying machine will only get better.  We will learn better how to convince &ndash; first voters and then funders, on our way to recruiting incumbents to reform.&rdquo;'
   - '&ldquo;In 2014, less than 2% of America gave anything to anyone running for Congress. But of those who did, the top 100 gave as much as the bottom 4.75 million.  Less than .05% gave the maximum in even one election cycle.  Less than half of that gave the equivalent of the maximum in both cycles.  And 100 Americans gave 70% of the SuperPAC money spent through the cycle.  We have to change this, if we&rsquo;re to give ordinary Americans a reason to care about their politics again.&rdquo;'

  quotes:
    - 'We can&rsquo;t give up on fixing this problem. There are too many issues that need a government that can think &ndash; from climate change to the deficit, from inequality to a crazy tax system, from endless spending on &ldquo;defense&rdquo; to endless gifts to crony capitalists. And we will only ever get a government that can think sensibly if we change the way elections are funded.'
    - 'So no, obviously, we didn&rsquo;t give up. Instead, we went back to the drawing board. The key lesson that now frames our thinking is the recognition that we can&rsquo;t do something different unless we are different too.'
- title: 'Huffington Post: Mayday II'
  link: 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-mandle/mayday-ii_b_6212492.html'
  quotes:
    - 'But victory will require more than committed candidates. Voters must turn out at the polls to elect them, something which at the moment and despite Lessig&rsquo;s optimism, they are not prepared to do. For that to happen the electorate will have to be convinced that publicly funded candidates will be responsive to the needs of the middle class and low income groups in ways that the current cohort of privately funded elected officials are not. To win, reform candidates will have to combine their call for public funding of elections with the promise to enact policies that materially improve voters&rsquo; lives by, for example, increasing the income and employment of those who have been most shut out of the country&rsquo;s economic gains. Such campaigns will require a massive field operation. People will not be convinced by television ads that politics really can be changed. Person to person persuasion will be needed.'

  quotes:
    - 'A great beneficiary of Lessig&rsquo;s vision, if its realization properly is structured, is our elected officials. Lessig doesn&rsquo;t intend to, and does not, undermine their job security. Adopting his plan would improve the quality of our officials&rsquo; lives immensely. Lessig isn&rsquo;t prescribing Castor oil. If he stops treating it like something one has to coax a recalcitrant child into taking &ldquo;for your own good&rdquo;  he will encounter far less opposition.'
    - 'If he presents it shrewdly, Lessig&rsquo;s most enthusiastic constituency well could become ... Members of Congress. Our elected officials almost unanimously detest having to spend the majority of their discretionary time dialing for dollars. These lovely people came to Washington to represent their district and make America a better place. Lessig&rsquo;s plan could make doing that job easier and much more delightful (both to us voters and our Representatives).'

  quotes:
    - 'Mayday&rsquo;s laying its plans right now, and there are a couple of avenues for that. There&rsquo;s this army of people &ndash; almost 70,000 people now &ndash; who donated to Mayday in the last round. And they want to basically work with that group to turn them into citizen lobbyists and storm all these members of Congress and ask them to sign on.'
    - 'Mayday&rsquo;s constituency, Mayday&rsquo;s tribe, is made of people who are frustrated by how the system works. And it should be focused on them, and frankly it seems like it&rsquo;s more a small-dollar community than a big-dollar community. That means there&rsquo;s going to be more patient, grassroots-focused organizing, but it also means that there&rsquo;s going to be an army of constituents in all these cities across the country that can do lobbying work. And giving people more avenues to have an impact than just donating is going to be a key part of Mayday&rsquo;s future.'

  quotes:
    - 'What Lessig wants to do is change the calculus of politicians by empowering citizens to give &ndash; and candidates to accept &ndash; small campaign donations.'
    - 'People would get a $50 tax rebate via a voucher they could then give to candidates. Candidates would parlay those into potentially very significant matching funds, perhaps in a 6-to-1 ratio.'

  quotes:
    - 'Lawrence Lessig, who teaches law at Harvard, is a well-known Internet activist and campaign finance reform advocate. This election cycle, he started a crowd-funded SuperPAC aimed at reducing the influence of money in politics. Lessig tells Bill: "Our democracy is flat lined. Because when you can show clearly there&rsquo;s no relationship between what the average voter cares about, only if it happens to coincide with what the economic elite care about, you&rsquo;ve shown that we don&rsquo;t have a democracy anymore."'

  link: 'http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-19/the-learned-helplessness-of-the-american-voter'
  quotes:
    - 'I spoke by phone last week with the political activist and Harvard Law School professor Larry Lessig, who earlier this year launched Mayday, a self-styled &ldquo;crowd-funded SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs...including this one,&rdquo; to agitate for campaign-finance reform (although he considers that phrase a euphemism comparable to &ldquo;liquid-intake problem&rdquo; for alcoholism). Mayday has raised over $10 million to date, but saw only mixed results in the races that it invested in. Lessig&rsquo;s sure the public can be rallied, but admits that it&rsquo;s a long road. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the camp of people who think it&rsquo;s not quite fair to criticize&rdquo; people who wonder what reason there is to vote. He said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s pretty reasonable for people not to engage in a system like this.&rdquo;'

  quotes:
    - 'While we have data that demonstrates voters in these races did care about the issue, it simply wasn&rsquo;t enough&ndash;in an election of this kind of historic proportion&ndash;to make enough of a difference. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t in the future. Those of us who are committed to this issue see it the same light you might if you got a fatal cancer diagnosis for your child. The stakes are just too important. So, despite the odds, you don&rsquo;t give up.'
    - 'And we won&rsquo;t. What particularly pains me in this instance, is not so much the electoral losses, but the apparent glee that some of Lessig&rsquo;s detractors, and even some of his colleagues in the reform movement jealous of his attention, have expressed over the outcome. Having worked closely with Lessig and many others over the years on these issues, I say this confidently: There is no more passionate, committed, creative and articulate advocate on these issues than Larry Lessig.'

  link: 'https://medium.com/@jslovegrove/mayday-mayday-how-not-to-reflect-on-campaign-finance-reforms-disastrous-2014-election-night-321fcc3f364c'
  quotes:
    - 'So let&rsquo;s be perfectly clear about this: The notion that quiet, behind-the-scenes politicking can someday lead to comprehensive campaign finance reform is patently absurd. We&rsquo;re talking about reversing the effects of the most significant and well-known Supreme Court decision since Bush v. Gore, drastically shrinking a multi-billion dollar industry overnight, and wrenching power away from some of the most power-hungry people in the entire world.'
    - 'Lessig was not &ldquo;siphoning off money that could have [been] spent more effectively by existing groups,&rdquo; he was raising money that otherwise would likely have never gone towards campaign finance reform at all. Maybe the &ldquo;ivory tower egghead&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;radio voice,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s brought new energy, supporters and ideas to a campaign that sorely needed them. Instead of trashing Lessig in Politico, his ostensible allies should be thanking their lucky stars he joined the team.'

  quotes:
    - '&ldquo;We need to engage in more primaries,&rdquo; he recently told his supporters. But figuring out how to appeal to 2016 Republican primary voters on the issue of campaign finance overhaul could be as difficult as winning elections this year.'
    - 'The right context for Mr. Lessig are primaries that won&rsquo;t call for voters to cross party lines for the issue of campaign finance. &ldquo;The data supports the idea that we could move partisan voters toward our issue in safe seats more easily than contested seats,&rdquo; he said.'

  quotes:
    - 'Americans undoubtedly assume their political leaders are on the take. When asked if they favor laws to reduce money in politics, 90 percent say yes. Lessig believed the polling data along with some cherry-picked academic scholarship contained the recipe for a political movement. But his polling said nothing about the public&rsquo;s passion for campaign finance reform or even good government.'

  quotes:
    - 'Embracing the irony of setting up a super PAC that would spend big money in order to fight super PACs and other groups that spend big money, Harvard professor Larry Lessig and GOP strategist Mark McKinnon went all-in on the idea voters would kick megadonors to the curb.'
    - 'Tuesday, voters shrugged and cast their ballots for business as usual, leaving Mayday and Lessig &ndash; who emerged as its public personae &ndash; facing questions about the disconnect between its bold predictions and results.'

    - 'Enter Mayday Super PAC, a crowd-funded Super PAC, or political action committee, to end all Super PACs. The Mayday Super PAC uses its investors&rsquo; dollars to "elect a Congress committed to fundamental reform in the way political campaigns are funded by 2016."'
    - 'You don&rsquo;t need to think too hard about the value proposition. In fact, don&rsquo;t even bother modeling the upside of an investment in the non-partisan Mayday Super PAC. See it as a bargain-basement insurance policy against keeping years of your hard-earned social, environmental, and financial value creation from tumbling uncontrollably from its peak.'

  quotes:
    - 'Not that the trope of PACs barreling into states and informing voters of which candidate is and is not native enough is reserved for conservatives. Mayday PAC, Larry Lessig&rsquo;s reform group, has focused its ad money in South Dakota on folksy ads starring real Dakotans who are fed up with the insiders and corruption.'

  quotes:
    - 'The biggest outside spender for Clements has been the Mayday PAC, a campaign finance reform political action committee that has spent more than $2 million on his behalf, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Most national environmental groups have been more restrained in their spending on this race, however.'
    - '&ldquo;It would be the upset of the election cycle if Paul Clement beats Fred Upton, particularly since Upton handily won this seat in 2012," said one national environmental leader, speaking on background to discuss the race more openly. "It would demonstrate that voters will vote against business as usual if they have the facts linking their representative&rsquo;s campaign cash to his special interest favors."'

  quotes:
    - 'With outside money flowing into big races at a record clip, Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s Mayday PAC has been one of this cycle&rsquo;s curiosities. Its stated aim: To elect candidates who will limit big money in politics by spending big money on politics.'
    - 'While the group has been successful in drawing attention to its unconventional mission and to some of its races, Tuesday will give political observers the first hint of whether the group&rsquo;s pro-reform message has legs. Mayday&rsquo;s candidates include independent Greg Orman in Kansas and Democrat Rick Weiland in South Dakota, both of whom are in tight races &ndash; but, win or lose, the group has already pledged to compete in 2016.'

  quotes:
    - 'Despite his rightward lurch in a purple district (and his smaller margin of victory in 2012), the national Democratic Party, somewhat mysteriously, hasn&rsquo;t put much money into challenging him. But earlier this month, the Mayday PAC &ndash; a crowd-funded PAC founded by Laurence Lessig to elect candidates that will help reduce the influence of money in politics &ndash; put $1.5 million into the race; this week it announced it&rsquo;s spending $650,000 more.'
    - 'Political observers, including environmental groups, have generally regarded the campaign of Upton&rsquo;s challenger, Western Michigan University professor Paul Clements, as quixotic. LCV hasn&rsquo;t gotten involved. Tom Steyer hasn&rsquo;t gotten involved. But with some money behind him enabling him to get his message out, Clements is surging.'

  quotes:
    - 'Taking center stage in the race is the role of outside money. Mayday PAC, a crowd-funded super PAC has launched a $2.15 negative ad campaign against Upton. The ads partly accused Upton of taking more than $2.5 million from "big drug, insurance, and related interests &ndash; while voting against allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors and in favor of allowing insurance companies to deny care to people with pre-existing conditions."'
    - 'Upton&rsquo;s campaign has denied all of the allegations. In an interview with the Kalamazoo Gazette Editorial Board, Upton said some Mayday funders are regretting their decision. He declined to name the funders.'

  quotes:
    - 'If Upton loses next Tuesday, it would be a major victory for the Mayday PAC, which has been funded in large part by tech executives. Singling him out as the &ldquo;worst of the worst&rdquo; is a risky bet for Mayday&rsquo;s tech industry backers, however, given Upton is the top Republican on the Energy & Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over Internet, media and telecom companies.'
    - 'Upton&rsquo;s campaign has been putting out fires since the frustrated candidate told a local newspaper he&rsquo;d called some of Mayday&rsquo;s tech funders to complain. (His campaign has since denied either the candidate or his aides called donors.) In an interview, Tom Wilbur, Upton&rsquo;s campaign manager, would only say that &ldquo;from Fred&rsquo;s perspective there&rsquo;s only two ways to run, unopposed or full-speed ahead.&rdquo;'

  link: 'http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/11/so-what-are-the-d-c-insiders-really-afraid-of/'
  quotes:
    - 'Despite the fear-mongering, and especially if the states use a &ldquo;compact&rdquo; to agree in advance on how the process would work, a serious case can no longer be made that a convention would run wild. An Article V convention has no power to change the constitution on its own. Its only power, as the Constitution plainly states, is &ldquo;for proposing Amendments.&rdquo; And evidence now available because of the Internet to every American shows that it was the political bodies closest to the American people, state legislatures, that were meant to use the Article V convention process to propose the necessary constitutional changes.'
    - 'The framers gave us the amendment by convention procedure to provide a way around a Congress stalemated by its insiders. Americans from across a political spectrum are now working together to use that gift. The insiders will squeal. But that is precisely the point: they have failed to fix the fundamental problems that we now face. We must now use the tools the framers gave us to solve the problems that the insiders won&rsquo;t.'

  quotes:
    - 'Well look at what&rsquo;s going on in Hong Kong. They want to have a two stage election. And in the first stage, a small committee of 1,200 people get to pick the candidate. So 1,200 out of five million is about .024 percent of Hong Kong picks the candidates who get to run in the general election.'
    - 'So in America, like in Hong Kong, we have a two-stage process. And at the first stage, a tiny fraction of our democracy chooses the candidates who get to run, effectively, in the second stage. And so it&rsquo;s just like that two-stage process in Hong Kong.'

    - 'The group is relying on a similar tactic in South Dakota, where it&rsquo;s up with an ad featuring a Republican rancher and father of 12 who says he can&rsquo;t support Republican Mike Rounds for Senate because of a controversy over his role in a questionable EB-5 visa program. The rancher, Pat Trask, claims to have voted for Reagan and Bush &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t say which one &ndash; as well as South Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune.

Donnelly&rsquo;s Every Voice super PAC, and another even better-funded super PAC dubbed MayDay PAC, are spending their own unrestricted money to back candidates that support campaign restrictions, helping move the issue front and center.'

    - 'Weiland&rsquo;s opposition to campaign finance has earned him the support of Larry Lessig&rsquo;s Mayday PAC which aims to reshape Congress in the 2016 elections and get legislation enacted to reduce the influence of money in elections in early 2017. Weiland acknowledged that taking money from the Super PAC to end all PACs is ironic, but Rounds was unwilling to change the campaign rules. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tie both hands behind my back,&rdquo; he said.'

    - 'The campaign has $127,000 cash on hand, a fraction of the $1.6 million Upton has left over after raising nearly $3 million this election.

That&rsquo;s been enough to put a serious scare into Upton, who won his last election with 55 percent of the vote in a swing district that Obama carried in 2008 and lost, narrowly, to Romney in 2012.

The group, Mayday PAC, aims to target politicians beholden to moneyed interests. On Oct. 9, it named Upton among its handful of targets for the 2014 cycle.'
    - 'While Upton maintains the super PAC attacks haven&rsquo;t changed his strategy&ndash;or made him any more vulnerable&ndash;his opponents see a candidate on the defensive. Mayday&rsquo;s first ad targeted the incumbent on Medicare drug prices and failing to protect patients with preexisting conditions. Days later, an Upton ad lamented the "lies" opponents were spreading and touting his efforts to help seniors on Medicare and patients with preexisting conditions.

The investment will likely be met with some skepticism, coming so soon after a failed attempt by Lessig to help a little-known New Hampshire Senate candidate defeat Scott Brown in the GOP primary. And most Democrats have long written off this open seat &ndash; the forecasters view Weiland as an overwhelming underdog, and he hasn&rsquo;t led in a single poll:'
    - 'But in an interview, Lessig argued to me that Weiland could win, and that his victory would help prove that voters care about reforming corruption in politics. "Our objective is to demonstrate something that people in Washington don&rsquo;t believe, which is that voters will vote on the basis of this issue," Lessig says.

    - 'Mayday.us, the crowd-funded Super PAC launched by Larry Lessig to back "anti-corruption," and pro-campaign finance reform candidates is beginning a $1 million ad buy in South Dakota&rsquo;s heretofore sleepy Senate race. It&rsquo;s on behalf of Rick Weiland, the Democratic candidate and two-time loser of statewide races who, up until now, has been considered an afterthought.'
    - 'So, why would Mayday walk onto the field? The PAC points to a new Public Policy Polling survey that shows Republican Mike Rounds, a former governor who easily won two terms, slipping to 35 percent support against Weiland&rsquo;s 28 percent. Weiland&rsquo;s favorables have surpassed those of Rounds; in a four-way race with former Senator Larry Pressler and conservative Gordon Howie, PPP suggested that Weiland had the most potential to surge.'

But to be able to run in a primary, or in a general election, those candidates must secure an extraordinary amount of campaign cash. The providers of that cash aren&rsquo;t all of us. And they are certainly not even a representative sample of us. They are instead a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1 percent (arguably the same proportion of America as 1,200 is of Hong Kong), which, as a massive empirical study by Princeton&rsquo;s Martin Gilens and Ben Page suggests, produces a government that is responsive to the &ldquo;economic elite and organized business interests,&rdquo; but not at all to &ldquo;the preferences of the average American.&rdquo; We have, like Hong Kong would have, a biased filter at the first stage of our democracy.

How could we believe that the thickness of one&rsquo;s wallet is the metric of citizenship?&rdquo; He sketched a dire portrait of American politics. More than ninety-nine per cent of Americans are excluded from the access that large campaign donations afford, he said. And yet people have accepted this state of affairs. He cited a poll in which ninety-six per cent of Americans said they believe that it&rsquo;s important to reduce the influence of money in politics but only nine per cent believe that it is likely to happen. The Mayday PAC, Lessig said, was intended to elect a Congress that would pass reform and demonstrate to Americans that change was possible. &ldquo;This is the moral question of our age,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can we reclaim our democracy?&rdquo;'

That bias produced a democracy responsive to whites &ndash; only. The battle for equal rights was a fight to remove that illegitimate bias, and give African Americans an equal say in their government.'
    - 'Today there&rsquo;s no "white primary." Today, there&rsquo;s a "green primary." To run in any election, primary or general, candidates must raise extraordinary sums, privately. Yet they raise that money not from all of us. They raise it from a tiny, tiny few. In the last non-presidential election, only about .05 percent of America gave the maximum contribution to even one congressional candidate in either the primary or general election; .01 percent gave $10,000 or more; and in 2012, 132 Americans gave 60 percent of the superPAC money spent. This is the biased filter in the first stage of our American democracy.'

  quotes:
    - 'This is the thing about Mayday, as Harvard law Prof. Lawrence Lessig, one of the co-founders of the group, explained to the Post by phone: 2014 is, for them, the equivalent of poking an anthill with a stick to see what happens. Granted, they&rsquo;ve got better analytical tools than sticks, and they&rsquo;re being more thoughtful about what gets poked, but the analogy is generally accurate. By investing in a variety of races in 2014, Mayday hopes to learn if voters are sufficiently receptive to a campaign finance reform message to justify a bigger and better-funded push in 2016.'
    - '"The interventions that we&rsquo;re picking, we&rsquo;re kind of picking to fill out the various corners of the data matrix," Lessig told us, calling the New Hampshire results "pretty interesting and confirming."

He writes that 37% of primary voters surveyed said "reducing the corrupting influence of politics [sic] was a major or deciding factor in their vote for Senate." (I think Lessig means reducing the influence of private money in politics, but does no one proofread his emails for him?) That said, a large chunk of that group apparently gave their votes to Brown (or, as Lessig put it "among that 37%, our candidate beat the Republican nominee by 18 points!") which shows just how hard it is to impact voters&rsquo; opinions in a meaningful way.'

    - 'The candidates selected will need to take a position on hard issues, like the five outlined at reform.to, which provide concrete plans to create a small donor system for campaign financing: matching citizen contributions and providing voters with vouchers.'
    - 'Lessig explained that candidates will be held accountable by committing to co-sponsoring a reform on campaign finance. The reason, said Lessig, is &ldquo;if you get a majority of members [of Congress] who sponsor a piece of legislation, you have a tool to leverage that legislation on the floor."'

  quotes:
    - 'Long story short: the color of Mayday&rsquo;s small-online-donor money is distinctly blue. Actually, this may not be too surprising a result (though it&rsquo;s still worth quantifying): I suspect liberals today tend to feel persecuted by PACs, and probably for good reason, whereas conservatives tend to like rampant big-money-in-politics just fine, thank you very much.'

  quotes:
    - 'Mayday PAC explicitly says it wants to select five races that are tight enough so that it can claim that its campaign finance reform agenda made an impact. That&rsquo;s where things get tricky. For one thing, most Congressional races aren&rsquo;t even competitive, as Derek Willis notes at The Upshot, and the vast majority of incumbents win reelection. For another, campaign finance reform is not top-of-mind when most voters go to the polls...'

    - 'According to Lessig, Silicon Valley is uniquely positioned to change the power of wealth in American politics. Unlike the finance or energy industries, Silicon Valley has yet to mature to the point where it seeks to boost profit through legislative reforms.'
    - 'In some sense, Mayday&rsquo;s approach seems paradoxical: taking money from one major industry and pitting it against another (the devil you know, and all that). But as Lessig points out, Mayday isn&rsquo;t aimed specifically at pro-Silicon Valley legislation, like that pertaining to visas or net neutrality. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be a very principled or interesting PAC,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The only thing the Mayday PAC is trying to do is get legislation passed to change the way elections are funded.&rdquo;'

  quotes:
    - 'According to an interview with VICE, Lessig was one of the people behind the publication of the Congressperson&rsquo;s daily schedule, which blocked out four hours per day for fundraising. Lessig said, &ldquo;members of Congress were like, &lsquo;What the hell? Why am I here? I didn&rsquo;t want to become a telemarkter.&rsquo;&rdquo;'
    - 'In fact, Lessig says this is why the latest Congress has been the most unproductive of our history, because while it is very difficult to pass legislation, it can be very easy to block it. The corruption doesn&rsquo;t come in these legislators writing bills for their donors &ndash; that&rsquo;s what lobbyists do &ndash; it is in their ability to block legislation their donors don&rsquo;t like.'

    - 'The cost of the 2014 pilot was estimated at $12 million. And so on May 1, we launched an experiment to see whether we could raise money through a Kickstarter campaign for at least half. We set an initial goal of $1 million in 30 days. Insiders thought this was impossible, but with the help of 13,000 supporters, with a median contribution of just $50, we crossed the $1 million mark in 13, not 30, days.'

In May, Lessig launched a radical initiative to address the issue: MAYDAY, a SuperPAC that secured funding from two Silicon Valley billionaires in order to curtail the influence of big money.'
    - '"It makes me sick to imagine the amount of time [presidential candidates] spend raising money, but the institutional [issue] we have to do something about quite dramatically is Congress. Because Congress is increasingly an institution that spends all of its time in the business of raising money as opposed to the business of trying to figure out what the right thing to do is."'

The May Day PAC established by Lawrence Lessig takes the stance that U.S. electoral politics are entirely controlled by corporate interests due to the realities of campaign financing: Politicians who do not attract lavish spending by corporations and wealthy individuals simply cannot succeed under the current rules.'

    - 'The aim of the super PAC is to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. Fundamental reform in the way elections are funded.

We voters have more power than we think we do! On Tuesday, a congressional primary race in Virginia was won by a newcomer to politics who raised just over $200,000 for his campaign. His losing opponent (the incumbent) raised over $5 million.'
    - 'In his book "Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress &ndash; and a Plan to Stop It," Lawrence Lessig proposes nonpartisan plans to end it. It&rsquo;s a 300-page book, but let me wet your appetite with one paragraph from page 266. "First, we convert the first $50 dollars that each of us contributes to the Federal Treasury into a voucher. Call it a &lsquo;democracy voucher.&rsquo; Each voter is free to allocate his or her democracy voucher as he or she wishes. Maybe $50 to a single candidate. Maybe $25 each to two candidates. Maybe $10 each to five candidates. The only requirement is that the candidate receiving the voucher must opt into the system.'

I&rsquo;m not talking about "money exchanged under the table" corruption, but rather what Harvard Professor Larry Lessig terms "dependence corruption" &ndash; the totally legal dependence that our elected officials have upon the powerful interests that make (and, crucially, break) their campaigns.'
    - 'This is the cold, hard reality: Any member of Congress who supports gun control legislation today faces a tidal wave of NRA money aimed squarely at kicking them out of office. In the 2012 federal election cycle, the NRA spent nearly $20 million to defeat politicians &ndash; both Democrats and Republicans &ndash; who voted in favor of gun regulations, and to elect politicians who championed unfettered access to guns.'

And, yes, we already wrote about this at the beginning of May when the first phase launched, and again when it hit the $1 million goal &ndash; and then secured the second million in matching funds. However, the project has now moved into phase two, where the goal is to raise (and match) $5 million, instead of just $1 million. Already it&rsquo;s around half a million dollars, so there&rsquo;s a long way to go, but it&rsquo;s a good start.'
    - 'And, once again, the goal here is to raise this total of $12 million ($1 million + $1 million match in May, and then $5 million + $5 million match in June) as a test for a much larger effort. I&rsquo;ve seen too many overly cynical folks say "$12 million isn&rsquo;t enough to change politics." And you&rsquo;re right. But that&rsquo;s not the goal.

    - 'This is the hard work that Congress should do. It&rsquo;s easy to hold hearings on resolutions that everyone knows will fail. It takes leadership to force debate on ideas that no one believes can pass&ndash;but must pass.

And for SuperPACs, the numbers are even tinier. In the 2012 election cycle, 132 Americans contributed 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in all races. Congress has become dependent upon this tiny slice of the 1 percent, but in no conceivable way does this tiny fraction represent America.&rdquo;'

    - 'We&rsquo;ve reached a tipping point for reform. The Great Recession that began in 2007 exposed government and private institutions as deeply flawed and unable to protect ordinary people. The Supreme Court, contrary to common sense and the beliefs of most Americans, has declared that corporations are people and that enormous spending by a billionaire on politics is speech legally equivalent to actual speech by an ordinary citizen.'

"Mayday PAC&rsquo;s success will prove that there are enough people willing to invest in sending Congress the message that it is time for fundamental campaign finance reform." Mark McKinnon adds, "We want a government that works for all of us, not simply the wealthy who bankroll campaign contributions and Super PACs."'
    - 'This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People "commit" by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.'

  quotes:
    - 'The Mayday PAC, launched on May 1, announced a crowd funding plan to raise $12 million to back supporters of publicly financed elections in 2014. If people help raise $1 million, with contributions of $10,000 or less, in one month, Lessig said wealthy supporters would kick in another $1 million. The group raised its first $1 million by the middle of May.'
    - 'The big supporters providing the matching $1 million include LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder and president of Thiel Capital Peter Thiel, TED curator Chris Anderson, Union Square Ventures partners Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Women&rsquo;s Entrepreneurial Festival co-founder Joanne Wilson, and Schooner Capital founder Vin Ryan.'

  quotes:
    - 'In January, Gallup found that Americans from across the political spectrum picked the failure of &ldquo;government&rdquo; as the top problem facing America today. The vast majority link that failure to the influence of money in politics. Yet more than 90 percent of us don&rsquo;t see how that influence could be reduced. Washington won&rsquo;t fix itself, so who else could fix it?'
    - 'It turns out the framers of our Constitution thought about this problem precisely. Two days before the Constitution was complete, they noticed a bug. In the version they were considering, only Congress could propose amendments to the Constitution. That led Virginia&rsquo;s George Mason to ask, what if Congress itself was the problem?'

  quotes:
    - '&ldquo;In 2016, number one, there will be fewer fights that we have to have, because people will get on the right side of this issue just out of fear,&rdquo; Lessig says. &ldquo;And number two, we&rsquo;ll have a whole bunch of people more interested in investing, because they see a potential return here.&rdquo;'
    - '&ldquo;[Vouchers] would radically change the business model of fundraising overnight,&rdquo; Lessig says. &ldquo;You would not have candidates spending their time talking to the tiniest fraction of the 1%. They&rsquo;d be thinking about the ways to attract a wide range of contributions from everybody who has a voucher.&rdquo;'

  quotes:
    - 'Is it possible to create a "super PAC" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes.'
    - 'If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle &ldquo;who are on the wrong side of this issue,&rdquo; Lessig said, &ldquo;then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data'

  quotes:
    - 'WASHINGTON &ndash; On May 1, Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig launched what he calls a "super PAC to end all super PACs."  Lessig, one of a new breed of campaign finance reformers, wants to change the corrupted system by which politicians now raise money for their campaigns.'
    - 'The irony is to get money out of politics, reformers must raise money of their own. On that measure, Lessig&rsquo;s new organization has gotten off to a super start.'

  quotes:
    - 'Just when you were fed up with our petty, craven politics and were ready to write off the next few years as a circus of filibusters, gridlock and investigations, comes an idea so simple yet subversive that it offers a glorious ray of hope.'
    - 'Call it [Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s](http://www.lessig.org/) "money bomb."  It&rsquo;s an ingenious plan to make the drive for small-dollar publicly funded elections a central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor&rsquo;s idea could help save the republic.'

  quotes:
    - 'Harvard&rsquo;s Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels that his fellow reformers don&rsquo;t think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors&rsquo; strangle hold on America&rsquo;s political system.'
    - 'In a recent piece in [*The Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/), Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a &ldquo;moonshot&rdquo; campaign &ndash; an ambitious, collective, national effort &ldquo;unlike anything they&rsquo;ve seen before&rdquo; &ndash; can &ldquo;crack this cynicism&rdquo; and usher in a more democratic system.'

  quotes:
    - 'Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its target.'
    - 'To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political spending.'
    - 'If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that&rsquo;s by design. Cynicism and defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig believes, that the only way to &ldquo;crack this cynicism&rdquo; is with an idea so exceedingly ambitious&ndash;a &ldquo;moonshoot,&rdquo; he calls it&ndash;that people might be roused to get behind it.'
    - '&ldquo;We must show Americans something unlike anything they&rsquo;ve seen before,&rdquo; Lessig&nbsp;<a style="color: #0c97d2;"href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/">writes</a>.'
